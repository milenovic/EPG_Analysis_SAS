# EPG_Analysis_SAS
SAS program for parameter calculation and statistical analysis of Electrical Penetration Graph (EPG) recordings. This is a modified version of Ebert 3.0 program for DC recorded whiteflies.

### Main changes:
* Automatic import of all .ANA files from the folder. Eliminates the need of copy/pasting sections of the code for every file.
* All input/output statements moved to the beginning to be more user friendly.
* Modifications to allow 12h recorging time to variables that are by hour.
* Implement automatic BoxCox transformation for all parameters.
* Added option to show transformation results (selected Î», residuals, Q-Q plots, etc.)
* Implement BY statement in PPROC GLIMMIX for automatic (and faster) analysis of all calculated parameters.
* Added functionaity to automatically export .csv summary containing untransformed means, min, and max with Tukey test letter grouping.
* At the end of analysis, add labels for all parameters for easy readability (e.g.: DurNpFllwFrstSusE2 = Duration of NP following first sustained E2)

### TO DO
* Make error checker display results in more user friendly way.
* Further optimizations for speed.
